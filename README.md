This is a really good video, I enjoyed it a lot. While watching the video, I was thinking about the effectiveness of the program and how it will impact the scammer. I concluded that it will likely not cause any major damage due to the false information that is being flooded looking too fake. 

### Identification of the problems and solution to fix or improve:
- Fake emails are all organized the same, following the order; first name, number, @[domain name].
- I will improve this by adding more data points, and arranging it randomly.
- Fake emails start with all lower case male first name.
- I will improve this by using a list of most used names in North America and not having all emails contain a first name.
- Fake emails are then all followed by the same domain.
- I will improve this by randomizing the email domains. Email domain usage is based on popularity of said email domain. 
- Fake passwords follow the pattern of being too random and only eight characters long
- I will improve this by making the passwords less random and fluctuating length.

**Disclaimer:** I did not run nor recommend running this program. A flooding tool is considered an attack and may be illegal in your country.
