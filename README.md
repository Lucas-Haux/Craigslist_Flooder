This is a really good video, I enjoyed it a lot. While watching the video, I was thinking about the effectiveness of the program and how it will impact the scammer. I concluded that it will likely not cause any major damage due to the false information that is being flooded looking too fake. 

### The problems and how I fixed them:
- Fake emails are all organized the same, following the order: first name, number, @[domain name].
  - I improved by randomaizing emails with names, nicknames, dates, and hobbies. With different capitalization.
  - I improved this by randomizing the email domains. Email domain usage is based on popularity of said email domain. 
- Fake passwords are too random and eight characters long
  - I improved by randomaizing emails with names, nicknames, dates, and hobbies. With different capitalization.
